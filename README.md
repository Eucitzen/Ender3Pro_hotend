What this design intends to do:
A simple design that can be ordered from a CNC company like JLCCNC or similar
Replaces the usual heater cathridges with a round heater element for more even heating while maintaining a repairable and replaceable baseline. (such as, replacing faulty heater)
It also intends to keep making use of the stock, original MK8 nozzles and modifying this model for other nozzles should be an easy procedure. Thus reducing the need to buy new nozzles all the time
